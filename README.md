Hello everyone, i dont ended the project, but it's my better, I worked hard for this.

I used Clear Code in this application because is the best way to coding.

In all application he code is clear and commented.

Well, you can run `ng serve --o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also verify code mistakes using the command `ng lint`
